Hierarchical RAG Summary Generation

Flow:
1. Load transcript chunks from ChromaDB.
2. Generate a summary for each chunk.
3. Combine all chunk summaries.
4. Generate one final comprehensive summary.

Direct port of the original Streamlit project's summary.py. Every
prompt, model parameter, batching strategy, and size heuristic is
unchanged — only the import of `get_all_video_chunks` now points at
`services.embedding_service` instead of the old top-level
`embeddings` module.
