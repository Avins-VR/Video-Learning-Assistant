## AI-Powered Educational Video Learning Assistant

🔗 Live Demo: https://intelligent-youtube-learn-ai.streamlit.app


> Transform any educational YouTube video into an intelligent learning experience using **Artificial Intelligence, RAG, LLMs, and Vector Databases**.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **AI-Powered Educational Video Learning Assistant** is an intelligent web application that converts educational YouTube videos into structured learning materials.

Instead of watching long video lectures repeatedly, students can simply provide a **YouTube URL**, and the system automatically generates:

- 📄 Video Summary
- 📝 Smart Notes
- 🧠 Concept Map
- ❓ MCQs (Easy, Medium & Hard)
- 🎯 Learning Recommendations
- 💬 AI Doubt Clarification (RAG Chatbot)

Additionally, users can download the generated **Summary**, **Notes**, and **MCQs** as **PDF files** for offline learning and revision.

# 🚀 Problem Statement

Millions of students learn from YouTube every day.

However, educational videos have several limitations.

## 1. Time-Consuming Learning

Students may watch a **1-hour lecture** just to understand **a few important concepts**, which consumes a significant amount of time.

---

## 2. No Structured Notes

Educational videos present information continuously.

Students must manually create:

- Notes
- Important Points
- Revision Material

This process is tedious and time-consuming.

---

## 3. Difficult to Understand Concept Relationships

Videos explain concepts sequentially.

Example:

```
Machine Learning
      ↓
Supervised Learning
      ↓
Regression
      ↓
Linear Regression
```

Students cannot easily visualize how concepts are connected.

---

## 4. No Self-Assessment

After completing a lecture, students often wonder:

> "Did I actually understand this topic?"

Traditional videos do not provide automatic assessments.

---

## 5. No Doubt Clarification

If students have questions like:

- What is Backpropagation?
- Why is Normalization important?

They must search again or rewatch the video.

---

## 6. No Learning Path Guidance

After finishing one topic, students often don't know:

> "What should I learn next?"

They spend additional time searching for the next relevant topic.

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system converts any educational YouTube video into an AI-powered interactive learning assistant.

The user simply provides:

```
YouTube Video URL
```

The system automatically:

- Extracts the transcript
- Understands the content
- Organizes knowledge
- Generates learning resources
- Answers user questions

---
